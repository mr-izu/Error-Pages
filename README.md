i uses to think,if we create a custom error page like other platforms then we can trick users into believe that url is actually not available
like we can use Url not found error on Backend servers etc.
This repo contains a list of Error pages for Koyeb,Heroku,Render etc.
Declaimer:COPYRIGHT BELONGS TO THE COMPANY,we are not using it against any terms infact it's way of security.

For example if i host my backend on example.koyeb.app and show the Koyeb not found error page then it will trick users to think that there is no project actually exist.
